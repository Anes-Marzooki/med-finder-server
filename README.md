# Welcome to the back end readMe file

### To start the server :

`npm run dev`

Unfortunately due to babel, the err will reference the **build** file, not the actual **src** file that we use.

still, it's pretty easy to figure it out.

### Dir structure :

\*All of the work happens inside the **src** folder. Inside it, you'll find :

```
src
|-- api
|--config
|--loaders
|--models
|--services
```

_You can learn more about the above, each has its readMe file._

\*There's also a **tests** folder that will hold all of our tests.

Please before doing anything in the tests folder, reach the scrum master first.

\*There's also a **build** folder that will hold all of our transpiled files.<br>

_please do not write anything in there._

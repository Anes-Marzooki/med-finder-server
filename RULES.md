# JavaScript Standard Style

we're not that serious about styling so having prettify with the default settings will be fine

important notes :

make to read the GUIDELINES and the RULES files b4 coding

use const and let avoid var as much as possible :100:

avoid == as much as possible ðŸ¤š
if you have to, inform the scrum master

we're using babel so don't bother your self with ES5 syntax

never leave any unhandled err always write a catch block even as simple as console.log(err)

dnt save anything in the local storage

b4 sending a pull request your comment on it should be in this form :

{{ the feature you added to the project}}
{{ the list of files you have changed }}
{{dependecies you added }}
{{dependecies you deleted }}

\* if you have changed a file without mentioning it in the comment the pull is likely to be refused

and last but not LEAST ðŸ™… no unused dependencies/variables just delete them also if you'll no longer use a dependency you downloaded inform the scrum master in your pull request comment

have fun hacking !!!
